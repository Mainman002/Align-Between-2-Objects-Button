# Align-Between-2-Objects-Button Blender 2.8x addon.

 ### By AIG

This script allows you to align any object along an axis between the centers of two other objects. 

This little script can be assigned to a hotkey and used with "Script Shortcut" https://github.com/snuq/Script-Shortcut

or PME https://gumroad.com/l/pie_menu_editor

In Blender, press the N Key to open the Tools Panel, select 3 objects (where the last one selected is the one you want to align) and then press the ui button.

Based on an idea of Andreas HÃ¥kansson.
