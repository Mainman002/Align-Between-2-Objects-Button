# Align-Between-2-Objects-Button Blender 2.8x addon.

 ### By AIG

    This script allows you to align any object along an axis between the centers of two other objects. 

    This little script can be assigned to a hotkey and used with "Script Shortcut" https://github.com/snuq/Script-Shortcut

    or PME https://gumroad.com/l/pie_menu_editor

    or just open a new Text Editor window in Blender, paste the code, select 3 objects, where the last one to be selected is the one you want to align and press play button.

    Based on an idea of Andreas HÃ¥kansson.
